The code for this website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mijndert/blog) and created using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Automated deployments are done by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev//) is used as the static site generator and the theme is a custom one created by me. The font in use is [Instrument Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Instrument+Sans). Syntax highlighting is done using the [11ty Syntax Highlighting plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/) and the theme is [Catppuccin Mocha](http://prismjs.catppuccin.com/mocha.css).
