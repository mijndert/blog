The code for this website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mijndert/blog) and created using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Automated deployments are done by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev//) is used as the static site generator and the theme is a custom one created by me. 

The font in use is [Instrument Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Instrument+Sans). Syntax highlighting is done using the [11ty Syntax Highlighting plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/) and the theme is [Catppuccin Mocha](http://prismjs.catppuccin.com/mocha.css).

## Tracking

Tracking is done using [Umami](https://umami.is/). I self-host the tracking script at `/scripts/script.js` and all data gets sent to their EU based datacenters. No identifiable information is collected.

## Sustainability

This website produces only [0.01g of Co2](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/mijndertstuij-nl/) every time someone visits. That's cleaner than 99% of all websites globally. This website is running on sustainable energy.
