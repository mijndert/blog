I'm a [lead platform engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mijndertstuij/) and solutions architect with over 17 years of experience building highly scalable infrastructure on top of public cloud providers. My extensive knowledge and interest into development practices make me a valuable asset for teams comprising of infrastructure engineers, developers, database administrators, and product managers. I always try to brigde the gap between technical and business requirements to come up with the best solutions that meet the overall company and team goals.

From a technical perspective, I always use the adage that if it's not in code, it might as well not exist. I love using Terraform to build out complex solutions using reusable modules that can transform any project into a well-managed Git repository where the code is clear enough to also act as the documentation.

During my free time I still take a deep interest in technical topics ranging from DevOps to cloud, and from development to up and coming tech like Gen AI. Other than that, I'm an avid runner, love spending time with my family and I try to read as many books as I can.

## Experience

**Otrium** - _Lead platform engineer_ (2023 - now)

As a Lead Platform Engineer I build upon the foundation of DevOps, with a strong focus on serving developers and stakeholders.

Key responsibilities:

- Infrastructure and cybersecurity: I oversee the design, implementation, and maintenance of our infrastructure, ensuring it is scalable, reliable, and secure.
- Partner management: I manage relationships with key partners such as New Relic and AWS. This involves leveraging their technologies, and ensuring we maximize the benefits of these partnerships.
- FinOps: optimizing costs, and ensuring we get the most value out of our investments. This includes monitoring usage, identifying cost-saving opportunities, and implementing best practices for financial management.
- Coaching and people management: I am committed to the growth and development of my team. I provide coaching, mentorship, and support to help team members achieve their career goals and enhance their technical skills.
- Stakeholder collaboration: I work closely with developers, product managers, and other stakeholders to understand their needs and provide solutions that enhance productivity and efficiency.
- Automation and efficiency: I develop and implement automation tools and processes to streamline workflows and reduce manual intervention. This includes creating CI/CD pipelines, automated testing frameworks, standardized templates.

In this role, I am dedicated to creating a collaborative and innovative environment where technology and people thrive together. My goal is to empower my team and stakeholders with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed.

**inQdo Cloud** - _Senior AWS Solutions Architect_ (2015 - 2023)

At inQdo Cloud I was responsible for multiple clients as a Senior AWS Consultant. I've worked with many clients in many different verticals over the years; from retail to banks, and from industrial companies to web agencies. I've worked on projects that involved moving entire datacenters into AWS, but also on quite a few projects that involved optimizing existing AWS landscapes.

My expertise lies with containers (ECS, EKS), CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code and highly scalable infrastructure.

I love empowering developers so they can focus on what they do best: delivering great applications and features to customers.

**Nines** - _Linux hosting engineer_ (2014 - 2015)

My responsibilities at Nines included managing the virtual and dedicated servers that cover the hosting environment, as well as improving and setting up cloud hosting environments on Amazon Web Services. My main focus areas were engineering, pre-sales and consultancy.

_Nines has been acquired by Sentia._

**We Are You** - _Systems administrator_ (2013 - 2014)

Worked with clients like van der Valk, Amsterdam Light Festival, Kia and Landal. Administration of about 100 Windows desktop clients, Windows servers (2003/2008/2012) running ASP.NET and Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) servers for infrastructure tasks. Managed two major client migrations to We Are You's (previously: RedHotMinute) own VMware ESX platform.

**Kaliber Interactive** - _Systems administrator_ (2008 - 2012)

As a system administrator at an internet company like Kaliber Interactive (previously: Rhinofly), there was a lot I could improve.

In short I managed the following things:

- Greatly reduced the amount of servers by deploying VMware ESX and going virtual with just about every bit of software. This not only reduced our footprint, it also reduced hardware expenses and maintenance costs.
- Introduced Cloud Hosting by using Amazon Web Services for highly scalable solutions. This reduced our maintenance costs even more and gave Rhinofly the ability to offer highly scalable solutions to it's costumers while being open about every step in the process.
- Deployed a scalable environment using mostly open source software for the Dutch government. Using various firewall, load balancer and caching solutions I managed to greatly reduce the amount of downtime and make it easier for developers to push new releases.
