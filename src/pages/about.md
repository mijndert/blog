<aside>This page is a work in progress. I will update it with more information soon.</aside> 

I'm a lead platform engineer and solutions architect with over 17 years of experience building highly scalable infrastructure on top of public cloud providers. My extensive knowledge and interest into development practices make me a valuable asset for teams comprising of infrastructure engineers, developers, database administrators, and product managers. I always try to brigde the gap between technical and business requirements to come up with the best solutions that meet the overall company and team goals.

From a technical perspective, I always use the adage that if it's not in code, it might as well not exist. I love using Terraform to build out complex solutions using reusable modules that can transform any project into a well-managed Git repository where the code is clear enough to also act as the documentation.

During my free time I still take a deep interest in technical topics ranging from DevOps to cloud, and from development to up and coming tech like Gen AI. Other than that, I'm an avid runner, love spending time with my family and I try to read as many books as I can.
