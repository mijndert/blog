It's the year of week notes on the desktop! (if you know, you know)

- My position at work involves a lot of non-technical work like talking to people and vendors, filling out spreadsheets, doing presentations. Which is all great, but I'm a nerd at heart so I allowed myself some time to do some engineering work this week. I really have to carve out more time for that kind of stuff.
- During a company-wide kick-off event, I presented how the tech team is going to contribute to the overall goal of the company for 2025 and beyond. I was a little nervous to present in front of 100+ people, but I got some really nice compliments afterwards.
- [Ellie](https://ellie.wtf/) has given me access to try [Atuin](https://atuin.sh/) Desktop and it's just incredible. It's still early days so it's all a little rough around the edges, but the potential is definitly there. I'll be sharing some more thoughts in a separate post soon.
- After the inauguration of the Orange Man, I decided to filter out a ton of words on Mastodon. My timeline is now a happy place once more.
- Last time I talked about how we're planning to have some work done to our garage. We received the first quote and _wow_ is it a lot of money. I kind of expected it, but not _this much_. Anyway, we have a few more quotes coming in so we'll see how it goes.
- Today I brought in my car for maintenance. Fingers crossed nothing unexpected pops up. 

That's it! Bit of a quiet week this one. Until next time!
