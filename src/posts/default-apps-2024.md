Here's a fun new thing in the blogosphere: sharing your default apps. I saw a few people I follow do it and borrowed the format, as one does. A ton more pages like this to look at are catalogued by [Robb Knight](https://defaults.rknight.me/).

I've always been a minimalist since having too much _stuff_ doesn't fit in my brain. The same is true on my electronic devices; having too many apps gives me a headache. As a result, this might be a rather boring list for most people, but I'm eager to see how it evolves over time.
