It's Friday again! Time to look back at the week.

- Our daughter is back to school after 2 weeks off. It was really nice having her around more, but it was also quite difficult to jugggle work and family responsibilities.
- Sam, our Corgi puppy, has been doing really well since the school break is over. It's a bit more quiet in the house, so he can get more rest which leds to better behavior all around. We're also focussing more on training him now that we have more time and he's doing really well. The biting has also decreased by a lot. A relief for us all.
- I took some time to finally take my Sony RX100 Mark IV out of storage. It's such a nice little camera with really great glass, a nice sensor and a ton of manual control. I'm taking it to more and more places now and I'm trying to figure out a bit of a worklow. I think I'll just stick to shooting jpeg since I don't have any fancy requirements. I can quite easily transer the photos from the camera to my phone using the Imaging Edge app. Then I do some quick edits in the Photos app.
- Once I get the hang of it again, I hope to make a page where I can showcase some of my photos right here on this website. I'll see what I can do with the design and overall layout.
- All this experimentation led to a messy desk, something I absolutely despise most times but this week it didn't really bother me.
- I've been reading way more this week, something which seems to help well with sleep quality.
- I noticed when I share a post on Mastodon, it doesn't show an image or the summary of the post. I need to set aside some time to make it a bit more presentable. Coming up soon!
