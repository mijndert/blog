summary: In which I waffle about computer monitors.
---

I think almost any nerd remembers their first computer monitor. Mine was a tiny CRT one that could only display a few lines of amber text. It was hooked up to an Intel 8086 I think and even though it was very outdated at the time already, it was my very first personal computer.

Fast forward to today, by now I've owned well over a dozen different computer monitors. Needs and preferences change, so you end up buying something else every few years because you think it will serve your needs or wants better than what you had before.

When COVID hit, we had 2 separate desks set up with 27 inch 4k displays. My wife needed a bit more space for her work and I didn't want to get into the trouble of having a multi-monitor setup. More so because we have wildly different tastes in computers and trying to connect it all in a manner that works for the both of us would have meant I also needed to buy a dock of sorts, adding to the cost. Instead, we opted for a single ultrawide display, the Dell P3421W. I continued working on my 27 inch 4k display and she got the ultrawide.

Little did I know, once you go ultrawide you can never really go back. I'm not all about "productivity" and "workflow" but the extra horizontal space means I can have my code editor and my terminal side-by-side very comfortably. By chance, we got a second ultrawide for free from someone who didn't use it and apparently didn't care about its monetary value. It was an HP Z38C that offered even more vertical space than our Dell monitor.

Back to the present. I've been using the HP monitor for the longest time now since I work remote and I want a nice monitor because I have to look at it for 40+ hours a week. Thing is, when you look at a computer monitor for that much time, you start to notice its tiny flaws. 

And then the new Dell U4025QW appeared.

No, I didn't buy it (yet?) but I read about it on RTINGS or whatever and immediatly put it on my wishlist. A 40 inch 5k2k ultrawide monitor that costs a whopping €1800. I would still run it at 1600p but the added pixels would mean text would be extra crispy. Do I need it? Absolutely not. Do I want it? Absolutely yes. I mean, it has all the ports, it has a little pop out thingy with even more ports! It's an Ultrasharp so the colors are supposed to be very good! 

Something unexpected happened with the HP Z38C though. My MacBook Pro ran out of battery even though it was supposed to be hooked up to USB-C. Turns out, if you don't use the extra fancy HP cable that comes with DRM, you only get 15 watts of power delivery. That annoyed the hell out of me so I took it out of my office and got the Dell P3421W back from retirement. I hooked it up to my MacBook, got 65 watts of power delivery and I'm back in business. 

First thing I noticed: the colors are way more vibrant than on the HP, apparently the HP was always a bit washed out. Another thing I noticed is that the Dell isn't _that_ much smaller. In fact, I think I actually prefer a smaller monitor. I'm someone who can't focus on anything at all, so multitasking never works for me, I just want my terminal and code editor side-by-side please. I don't need a 40 inch 5k2k monitor, what I need was sitting in my attic all along. Sure, it's not perfect: uniformity is a bit off, the text isn't as crisp as I would like, it doesn't have enough useful ports... But it doesn't cost €1800 either.

Still, the U4025QW is on my wishlist just in case. Maybe a smaller version of that monitor will come along some day.
