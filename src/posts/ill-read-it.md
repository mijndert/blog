I think with the ever growing power of mega corporations on the internet, writing a personal blog is a good way to keep the internet weird. It doesn't matter if it's about personal experiences, some very specific topic, or just random thoughts. 

It's difficult to keep writing and come up with topics to write about, more so when you feel like no one is reading along. Manuel is motivating people to start writing [by offering to read their blog](https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it) so you have your first reader.

So, I'd like to join Manuel in this effort. If you have a blog, [send it to me](mailto:mijndert@mijndertstuij.nl) and I will read it. Even better if you add an RSS feed so I can easily keep track of new posts. I like reading in English or Dutch, any and all topics are welcome.
