People that know me well will tell you that I'm not the most optimistic person in the world. I tend to see the negatives in things rather than the positives. I'm not proud of it of course, but it's something [I've been working](/now/) on for a while now.

I vouched to try to [default to optimism](https://stephango.com/optimism) and see the good in things and situations. 

As Steph Ango put it:

> The life of a pessimist is easy but dreary. The life of an optimist is hard but exciting. Pessimism is easy because it costs nothing. Optimism is hard because it must be constantly reaffirmed. In the face of a hostile, cynical world, it takes effort to show that positivity has merit.

As a family we unintentionally started a bit of a tradition. Every night at dinner we ask each other "what was the most fun thing that happened today?". 

A single question that helps us reflect on the day and focus on the positives. Our daughter loves it as well and it's a great way to get her to talk about her day. It's also a great way for me to practice optimism. Lastly it really helps with gratitude and storytelling skills â€“ making you think a little harder about what transpired during the day.
