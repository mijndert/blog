Remember me [waffling about computer monitors](https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/display-waffling/)? That was just six weeks ago. I have a confession to make: I bought it (yes this was shared in [week notes 5](https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-5/) already, but I have some more things to say now).

Admittedly, I wouldn't recommend anyone else do this, unless you've got a bunch of money to squander. I certainly don't, usually. But unexpectedly, I received some extra money to spend and I decided to treat myself for once. I'm always very good at convicing myself that I don't need the thing I actually really want to have. But this time, after much deliberation, I decided to go for it. And boy, was it worth it.

The Dell U4025QW is by far the best monitor I've ever owned.

It came packaged in probably one of the biggest piles of cardboard I've ever seen. The mark of a good quality product I guess. The entire unboxing experience was really easy and my new 40 inch 5k 120hz monitor was up and running on my desktop in no time at all. Getting rid of the giant mountain of cardboard was the hardest part.

Speaking about those specs: they don't matter. There are other monitors with similar specs and they don't matter either. What does matter is the sharpness of the text, the color reproduction, the insane ports selection, the build quality... I could gush over this thing for hours. My favorite thing is this little pop-out thing that has 1x USB-A and 2x USB-C, easily accessible on the front. Why didn't others think of this? Another really convient thing is the ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts the monitor's brightness. I didn't expect it to work very well, but it totally does! 

Anyway, I wanted to update ya'll on my waffling. I'm a total hypocrite for buying it anyway. Not that I feel sorry about it, I'm rather pleased with my purchase.
