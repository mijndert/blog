I keep saying this but, what a week! Not in terms of any super exciting new developments or anything, it's just busy at work and at home. Anyway, let's get into this week's notes because I have a lot to share this time around.

- A few days ago I posted a free startup idea on Mastodon: vibe coding keyboards (it's a keyboard with only a tab key). People seemed to resonate with it so I think there's a business opportunity there. Have at it.
- On Wednesday I picked up my bib for a local running event on Sunday. I'm just gonna soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the event, I don't have any goals in mind. 
- This week I posted about [needing to reset my inboxes](https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/reset-my-inboxes/). Work, life, everything has been pretty overwhelming lately and a constant barrage of notifications and information isn't helping. I'm already much happier with reducing the amount of inboxes and therefore noise.
- This tiny website is now [mentioned on 11ty.dev](https://www.11ty.dev/authors/mijndert/)! You'll hopefully see it pop up on the 11ty leaderboards soon.
- I've been working on my tan quite a bit this week. The weather has been absolutely gorgeous so I did a bunch of running. I'm happy with my pace at the moment and it can only get better from here as I'm also doing some strength training on the days where I don't go running.
- Another thing that happened this week: the internet was up in arms about something! Garmin is adding a subscription service and it's completely optional so far. I've seen people selling off their Garmin watch in response and I don't think that's the right move. They already have your money, the service still works. Let's just wait and see what Garmin will do next before doing anything drastic. It will however likely impact my decision to buy another Garmin watch in the future. 
- [Halls of Torment](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/) remains an incredible game. Having an absolute blast over here on my Steam Deck. Buy it if you haven't already.
- What's even going on at Red Bull Racing anymore? I'm really happy to see Yuki finally getting the seat, but I'm also really scared for his career. That car is obviously not great to drive for anyone other than Max Verstappen.

And that's it for this week! In the meantime, if you have anything to say, anything to share, any question, please [feel free to reach out](https://mijndertstuij.nl/connect/). I love getting emails from random people around the world.
