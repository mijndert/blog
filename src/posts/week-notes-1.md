This is my first ever entry in a new series. Just about every blog I follow does these week notes where they summarize what they've been up to. It's often very personal, sometimes it's about work or games or music. I always get something out of reading them, so I thought I'd give it a try myself. There's no particular format or structure and I'm trying to figure things out as I go. Bear with me.

Normally I'd publish these things on a Friday, but I just got back to work today and I wanted to get this out there. Here goes.

- I was off work for almost 2 weeks which was the longest stretch of not having to think about work in a long long time.
- New Years eve was rather uneventful. We stayed home because most other people we regulary hang out with during NYE had other plans. Maybe next year...
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) is my new terminal emulator and it runs great. Love the defaults so [my config](https://github.com/mijndert/dotfiles/blob/main/ghostty_config) is just 3 lines.
- I double dipped and bought [Diablo IV](https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/) again for my Steam Deck. Doesn't run great in endgame, but good enough to be enjoyable. Having a blast with the new class. Already put in well over 20 hours again.
- This website got quite a large refresh in terms of its design. I'm very happy with the result.
- After 2 months of being sedentary I got back into the habit of running. Planning to run a few events this year, with some 10k and 21k distances in there. The big one is going to be a 50k in November. Back to the grind!
- Still thinking of some new years resolutions, nothing is set in stone yet. I'm not going to make my life very hard or anything - I just want a quiet year with a bigger focus on myself and what my body needs.
- Been listening to one of my favorite bands [Switchfoot](https://www.switchfoot.com/) quite a bit after a long stretch of not listening to them.

That's it! I'll leave you with a playlist to listen to.
