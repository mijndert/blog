It's June already?! Times flies. Feels like last week that we were celebrating New Year's.

- I received my new Garmin Forerunner 570 which I wrote my first impressions of [here](/posts/garmin-forerunner-570/).
- I also wrote about my phone number being [poisoned](/posts/my-phone-number-is-poisoned/).
- On Thursday I went to the office for a team day. Always a good time seeing everyone again. We spoke a lot about AI, automated testing and tech debt.
- I made some minor changes to the website like adding a new favicon and updating some content here and there.
- My car, a 2019 Ford Focus ST-line, had to go in for maintenance. Luckily nothing major came up, just an oil change and a new air filter so the costs were reasonable.
- The Nintendo Switch 2 was released! I don't have one yet, I'm pretty sure I will at some point since my daughter loves playing Mario Kart on the OG Switch. I just don't see a reason to upgrade yet as there's not a ton of new games that take advantage of the new hardware.
