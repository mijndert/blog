Week 14 was a bit of a boring one. Luckily we have a race weekend coming up (in Japan this time, white RBR woo!), and we're gonna see our corgi puppy again. 

- This past Sunday I participated in the local 5k. Despite the wind, it was a pretty good race. My legs felt really good througout and I could really go for it in second half. Givse me some confidence for the next race that's coming up soon.
- On Monday and Tuesday I expierenced some pain and cramps in my right leg which I felt during my runs. I think it was just a fluke, it's all solved now anyway.
- I went to the office on Wednesday. Again I had to go the long way round (by train) because of issues near Rotterdam, but at least the weather was enjoyable. 
- I discovered and have been enjoying [Fickle Friends](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1nhSLEYdoBHG6cJ8NDwoF1) on Spotify.
- The Nintendo Switch 2 was announcend. I don't think I'm gonna buy it considering the price and how much I play games these days. Maybe I'll get one in a few years.
- I just wishlisted [Oh No! UFO!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314190/Oh_No_UFO/) on Steam. It's an indie game where you play as a tiny adorable UFO and you get to cause all kinds of chaos. Can't wait to play this on Steam Deck.
