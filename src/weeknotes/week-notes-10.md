Quite a few updates to share this week!

- The weather has been absolutely amazing these past few days. It's finally sunny and warm and nature is waking up!
- We've made some good progress on the project to insulate the garage. We finally have a pretty good game plan and we can close on some deals to make it happen.
- Another thing that's finally out of the way (I hope, let's wait another few days) is the trouble we've been having with our electric heat pump. When it's cold outside, it would make this terrible noise that kept us up at night. After many visits from technicians, it seems to be fixed now. And of course the fix was relatively simple, it just took a long while to figure out. 
- I haven't been running for almost 3 months now. I've been very busy with work and due to everything else going on in my life I haven't been feeling great both physically and mentally. I'm really hoping I feel well enough soon to pick running back up because I have an event coming up in May.
- I've been enjoying [Fusq](https://soundcloud.com/fusq) while working this week. I don't think why but it works really well with my brain.
- Firefox 136 is released and it has vertical tabs! The design is really well done in my opinion. I would highly recommend you check it out.
- Tonight we'll be binge-watching the new season of Drive to Survive on Netflix. And on Saturday I have a poker session planned with some friends. 

Happy Friday and enjoy the weather!
