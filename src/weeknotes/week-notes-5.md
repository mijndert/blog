New (not so) boring week, new notes!

- After 37 years of stumbling through life I got _unofficially_ diagnosed with ADHD. I'm now thinking of requesting an official diagnosis, but I'm not sure yet what that will bring me. It's not like it's impacting my performance at work or anything, every employer I've worked with has been really happy. Anyway, it's good to know I'm not totally crazy or stupid, and my suspicions were right all these years.
- Currently finishing up another crazy week at work. But it's a really good chance to step up as a leader more and more. I'm very much enjoying the challenge and the career growth.
- Again, didn't get to do any running or rowing this week because of everything that's been going on. I'm just too tired in the evenings to do anything. I hope to pick it back up again soon because my Garmin watch is screaming at me. I'm starting to sound like a broken record. Moving on.
- Yesterday my new computer display (Dell U4025QW) arrived. It was the most frivolous purchase I've ever made but I'm so happy. Everything looks so crisp, the port selection is insane, the build quality is really good, the light sensor is super useful and works very well. It's my dream display. I'll put a photo of my current setup down below.
- This weekend we'll meet up with some friends we haven't seen in a while to play boardgames. I'm terrible at boardgames but I'm looking forward to seeing our friends again.

I'll leave you with a YouTube recommendation. Even when she worked at The Verge I would watch all of her videos, every last one of them. But now she's gone independent and her videos are somehow even better. I'm talking about [Becca Farsace](https://www.youtube.com/@BeccaFarsace/videos). She takes tech outside. Go watch her videos.
