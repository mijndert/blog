- After many many months of noise coming from our eletric heat pump, I can safely say it's fixed! I gave the engineer who fixed it a nice bottle of whiskey that's how happy we are. We can finally sleep at night without turning the heat off.
- The new F1 season is underway with practice sessions in Australia already done. It's going to be an absolete banger of a season! Hamilton in a Ferrari, Kimi in the Mercedes, McLaren in the mix from the start, some other promising rookies in there. No clue how it's going to pan out and that excites me.
- [Steam Spring Sale](https://store.steampowered.com/) is here and I finally bought [Slay The Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) to play on my Steam Deck. Everyone kept saying it's a very addictive game and they... weren't wrong. I think I'll stick with this game for a good while.
- This morning I started running again, I feel like my body and mind are again in a place where I feel like I can do it. Of course I didn't take it easy because I wanted to benchmark myself a little bit to see where my limit is at currently. I wasn't disappointed at all, I still have a pretty good base to work off of. Just need to put some kilometers in over the coming weeks.
- I've signed up for a local 5k on the 30th of March to make sure I keep at it and have a bit of a goal to work towards. I don't have any specific finishing time in mind, I'm just gonna enjoy this one and use it to get back into the rythm.

That's about it for this week! Sunday I'm going out for dinner with a friend and next Tuesday we'll finally meet the Corgi puppies! Can't wait. See ya then!
