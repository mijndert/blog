What a week, huh? It's been a quick one again, with a lot of work done and a lot of things happening. Here are some highlights.

- After a call with a breeder we are now officially on the list for a Corgi puppy. After years and years of waiting and dreaming it's finally happening, or so I hope. We're gonna meet the puppies in about 3 weeks time and we'll see how that goes.
- I'm currently re-reading [The Night Agent by Matthew Quirk](http://matthewquirk.com/the-night-agent/). I've seen the tv show but honestly the book is better.
- I also started reading Bill Gates' new memoir [Source Code](https://www.gatesnotes.com/meet-bill/source-code).
- The 2025 F1 season is underway with 3 days of testing. Of course, nothing can be gleaned from testing, but it's nice to see the cars out on track again. It's going to be a tight field with some rookies that are very promising as well.

Lastly, I'll leave you with another song. Blues legend Buddy Guy and one of my favorite bands Switchfoot released a single together called Last Man Standing.
