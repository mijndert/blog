Yesterday on Mastodon I said that the week notes were cancelled because of people being really weird. But I thought about it a bit more and decided to just keep going anyway. I like writing them, even just for myself (not sure who's reading them anyway), and they make me reflect on the week which I think is very valuable.

Here we go again.

- Monday and Tuesday I was out sick with the flu. The allergies are still hitting hard this year which undermines my immune system. Luckily I have new medication that helps a lot better than the previous ones.
- Wednesday my wife had to get her immonutherapy treatment again so I took a day off to drive her to and from the hospital. It's always a long and emotionally draining day, but we got through. The next one is 6 months away.
- We've been playing a ton of Mario Kart World on the Switch 2 this week. We're really enjoying it and it's a great way to unwind.
- The weather has been excellent this week and will continue to be so for the forseeable future.
- [My phone use](/posts/smartphone-resentment/) is down by 40% week over week. I try to look at screen time a little more critically to see where I can improve even further. There's a lot of wasted time in there, time that often goes unnoticed. My phone needs to be a tool, and nothing more.
- After buying myself a [Garmin Forerunner 570](/posts/garmin-forerunner-570/) and a Switch 2 I'm in the process of selling my old Garmin 255 and my original Switch. The 255 is already sold at a very good price, the Switch is still available. I'm taking my time, not in a rush to sell at all.
