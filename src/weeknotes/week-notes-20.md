Week 20 is almost done! A round number, I like round numbers.

It's been a busy week again, with not much time to do anything besides work and puppy... things.

I did get around to adding a [photography](https://mijndertstuij.nl/photography) section to the site, which is something I've been meaning to do for a while. It's definitely a work in progress as I'm still not entirely sure what to do with the layout. And the photos aren't individual posts so I can't generate an RSS feed for them. I might look into fixing that at some point. At this point I have no clue what an elegant solution would be within the relative contraints of Eleventy.

Currently the photography section shows a bunch of photos from years past. Of course I fully intend to add new photos as I've taken my RX100 out of storage and I'm currently using it more and more.

The main point of this new page is to have it fully under my control and available on my own domain, not on someone else's platform.

Enough about that, though. This week I've also been doing some running which was really nice. But otherwise this week has been thwarted by seasonal allergies. I'm ready for spring to be over please.
