Another week done, another week of learning, of doing, of thinking. Here are the highlights.

- I got promoted at work to lead platform engineer. My department if you want to call it that is currectly called DevOps but I want to get rid of that. A platform team would serve the needs of the company much better. It's not going to be a single large change but rather a series of small changes.
- Work for some reason has been incredibly productive this week. Maybe I was running on pure adrenaline. In any case, my backlog is just about empty.
- It's been a long week with seasonal allergies ruining almost everything. I hope it lets off for a bit while we get some rain over the weekend.
- We've been selling a bunch of stuff online, sort of like a garage sale. We've also been giving away a lot of stuff for free. Feels good to have some space in the garage.
- I've been using my plain text TODO file for a while now to manage work and life. But I've been thinking of maybe moving it to Obsidian instead. A text file on your desktop doesn't scale very well obviously. I do like having a single file though. Whenever I try something like Reminders of Things, the tasks just end up in a black hole and I forget about them ever existing.
