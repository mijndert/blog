- After a good fews days with rain, the weather turned and we now have a lot of sunshine and heat. But with that, the seasonal allergies are making a huge comeback. I've been feeling terrible again and I'm so ready for the pollen to go away so I can start running again as well.
- I drove to Almelo, about a 2h15m drive, on Thursday to visit our warehouse where we have this giant robot for order picking. It's an amazingly large place and fascinating to see how that side of the business works.
- The biggest news of the week for me personally is that I ordered a Nintendo Switch 2 with Mario Kart World. I was hesitant at first, but then I got to try one and I was sold immediately. It's currently making its way across the border into The Netherlands and I hope it will arrive tomorrow, but Monday is more likely. I'm sure I'll share some more thoughts later on.
