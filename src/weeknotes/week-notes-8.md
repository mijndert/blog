- This week I finished reading [Extra Focus](https://www.extrafocusbook.com/). For me personally there wasn't a ton of new information in there, but it was nice to get some extra validation for all of the things I've been experiencing over the years.
- All of the extra responsibilities I'm given at work are starting to materialize. It's a busy but very exciting time right now.
- I've been going back to writing notes, todo items and other things on paper in a little notebook. The problem however is that it's very hard to keep it somewhat organized. I'm currently thinking about how I can best tackle this problem.
- I've been thinking about quantum computers for almost 30 years at this point. This week Microsoft [announced a new process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSHmygPQukQ) for creating a scalable error-corrected quantum chip. Obviously that's all very exciting. We need quantum computers to build better quantum computers, so in a few years time this innovation will only accelerate exponentially.
- Through the Welsh Corgi Club here in The Netherlands I enquired about getting a Corgi puppy. We've been dreaming about this for almost 8 years and we're finally in a position to make it happen.
