Another week has passed and it's time to share some notes.

- We went to see our Corgi puppy again this week. He's growing really quickly and he seems to really like cuddling. We're going to pick him up next week.
- We had people come to install a new garage door. Quite an expensive and big project but they really delivered. We now have a normal door to use to get in and out of the garage. The goal is to use the garage more once the puppy is here so that should really help.
- We bought all the stuff needed for a puppy like a bench, toys, food, a leash and much more. Really looking forward to having him around!
- My wife's company car was picked up today so we're now a one car family. We bought a 2019 Ford Focus 2 years ago and it wasn't really used much, but now that will finally change. It's a great car to drive after all.
- This weekend we're going to see Frozen the musical. My wife really wants to go but because of her disease it's quite the challenge. I hope she gets to enjoy it and that it doesn't take too much out of her.

That's it for now! Again, don't hesitate to [reach out](https://mijndertstuij.nl/connect/) if you have anything to say or share.
