I'm again way too late in posting these week notes. I really think I need to rethink my schedule and system here. It's been crazy busy with the puppy and work, and I don't have a lot of time left in the day to sit down and write.

In any case, here's a summary of the last week:

- Sam is slowly turning into a land shark with a lot of biting at our heels and pants. It's definitely a rough phase, and something that makes you doubt your decision to get a puppy. But with some really great help we're slowly working through it and learning his language more.
- We had someone come over for some maintenance on our electric heat pump. It was a bit of a hassle to get a skilled technician to come over, but it seems we've struck gold with this one. He was really knowledgeable and friendly, and he even fixed a small thing on our solar inverter as well.
- Together with my brother in law we made a really nice closet made out of kitchen cabinets from IKEA to go around our washing machine and dryer. The result is really nice and makes the space feel a lot more organized.
- On Wednesday I took the afternoon off to go to the forest with my family including Sam. Of course he passed out halfway through the walk and we had to carry him back. With his smol legs.
