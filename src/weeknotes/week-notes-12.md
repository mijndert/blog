What a week, lots has happened.

- It's been a really stressful week at work. Safe to say I need a quiet weekend to recover.
- Before the Steam spring sale ended I made sure to pick up [Halls of Torment](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/) for 4 euro's. It's kind of like a mix between oldskool Diablo and Vampire Survivors. Numbers pop up out of enemies and it has a whopping 500 achievements. Highly recommended.
- The F1 sesaon is underway! Last Sunday I woke up at 5am to watch the Australian GP and it was pure chaos because of the rain. This weekend the Chinese GP is on, I haven't seen anything yet because of the time difference and work but I'll catch up later. It's gonna be a banger of a season!
- Last Tuesday we finally met our Corgi puppy for the first time. We have to wait another 4 weeks now before he can come live with us. His name will be Sam and we're all very excited to welcome him into the family!
- One week left until the 5k event in my town. Due to work and other responsibilities I'm still not running and working out as much as I would like, but the times I have been running have been very promising. Even after this long hiatus I can still run a 27 minute 5k no problem. Really looking forward to the event and on to many more.

I'm gonna enjoy the sunny weather, F1 and some more Halls of Torment. See ya next week
