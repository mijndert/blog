Excuse me while I publish these weeks notes a little later than usual this time around. I've been busy gushing over Sam our new Corgi puppy. He's been an absolute joy to have around â€“ he listens very well, is playful, and has a ton of personality.

Some other things that happened this week:

- Last week on Sunday we went to see Frozen the musical. It was an amazing experience with a great cast, stunning visuals and an incredible orchestra. Highly recommended!
- We hired a puppy trainer to help with Sam and we met her for the first time this week. She gave us some great tips for the first few days. Next week we'll start proper training.
- On Wednesday I went to the AWS Summit in Amsterdam. When you've been working with AWS for 17 years it's kind of a tradition to go. Always nice to see familiar faces, meet new people, talk to some vendors and attend a session or two. Because AWS increases the sponsor fees the number of vendors was a lot lower than previous years, and also the food was quite a bit worse. But it was still a nice change of scenery from the usual work week.

Here's a photo of Sam when he just arrived at our home.
