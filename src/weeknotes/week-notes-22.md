This week hasn't been very eventful so I'll just give you an update on everything that's been changing on my website.

- The most obvious thing is the new layout. I sometimes think of a new purpose for the website, or I see something I really like on another website. I also changed the font to a sans-serif one because while I liked the serif one at first, it quickly became stale to me. I think the sans-serif font looks a bit more modern. I also put the navigation at the top to make it more accessible.
- Because the blog became overwhelmed by week notes I decided to separate them [into their own page](/weeknotes/). Now I have a blog page for general thoughts on technology, running, minimalism and everything in between, and a separate one where I share my week notes. I think this makes a lot more sense. 
- To separate the week notes from the blog posts, I needed to create new 11ty [collections](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/) anyway. Doing this also allowed me to create [separate RSS feeds](/feeds/). Now you can subscribe to the blog posts or the week notes separately, depending on what you prefer. The current feed still exists as well and contains both.
- I rewrote the CSS to use variables which hopefully makes it easier to maintain. 
- A lot of tiny under the hood changes like a rewrite of my eleventy config, restructuring the html, and removing unused code.
