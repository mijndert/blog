Week notes 2 already? Feels like I just wrote the first one. If time keeps flying by like this, it will be a very short year.

- I didn't do much running this week unfortunately as life got in the way. Maybe next week will be better.
- Work has slowly started picking up again now that everyone's coming back from their holiday break. We've got a pretty good roadmap ahead of us and I'm excited to get stuck in!
- I'm getting some extra responsibilities at work soon which I'm pretty excited about as well.
- We haven't seen the sun much over the past couple of weeks, but starting today we'll have a few days of clear skies. It's cold though!
- I kept on playing Diablo IV, trying to transform my Spiritborn into an endgame build and hitting at least 200 paragon before this season ends.
- I wrote down a few ideas for more blog posts which are coming soon. I'm trying to spread it out a little bit so I don't run out of things to write about and I don't want to spam your RSS readers either.
- Received some lovely blogs to read after my [call to send them my way](https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/ill-read-it/).

That's it! See ya next week.
