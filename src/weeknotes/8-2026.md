**The best thing that happened this week**

This week it was [carnaval in the southern part of The Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_in_the_Netherlands). As I'm originally coming from somewhere where they don't celebrate carnaval, I don't really celebrate it now either but my daughter is brought up with it. We went to see parades and my daughter went to a party for kids. She had a great time and that's all that matters.

Another really nice thing is that several people reached out via email to tell me they're enjoying my writing and are back to listening to Arctic Monkeys as well! I love getting email from readers, so if you have any thoughts to share, please do [reach out](/connect/).

**Playing**

I'm still playing [Kirby Star Allies](https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/Kirby_Star_Allies). I also put some time into [Boltgun](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005010/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun/) on my Steam Deck, which is getting a little repetitive I guess.

**Listening**

I found [another live set by Arctic Monkeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9_DFJsNu_0) so I'll share it here as well. A totally different genre but I've also been [listening to Nic D](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1XlLhtgJjC4ROQZilBZAvw?si=8BH365ypRHiZRox8jyXlTg) which before this week I hadn't heard of.

**Random things**

- I'm recovering from surgery under general anesthesia, which is a bit of a drag. Doing well though.
- Sam, our corgi, will be 1 year old tomorrow and we're having his stepsister over on Sunday because she's looking for a new home and we're considering adopting her. But first we have to see if they'll get along together.
- I'm in the process of replacing Nginx ingress with Envoy Gateway at work. It's a pretty steep learning curve, but it's really enjoyable so far. I love the challenge and the payoff is great because Envoy, to me at least, is much more enjoyable to work with.
- Some pages on this website have been shuffled around for better organization.
