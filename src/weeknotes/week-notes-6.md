Bit of a boring week (again) with not much going on. I was mainly working a lot to finish everything before I'm off for a week.

- I focussed on getting our backups in a better shape. All of our photos are stored in iCloud, but they're also now going to the Synology NAS automatically via the Synology Photos app. I've also set up a backup of the NAS to Backblaze for around $6/month.
- Went to see a couple of friends and we played some boardgames together. It was nice seeing them again and getting out of the house for a bit.
- On Wednesday I went to the office and had a pretty productive day there. Still takes almost 3 hours for a one way trip, though. I always need to recover the day after.
- The list of things I want to write about is ever growing but I just haven't found the time yet. I won't promise anything, just expect some more of these week notes with nothing else in between while I get on top of other stuff first.
- Next week we'll go an a little vacation for a few days. I expect lots of swimming, reading, relaxing and eating. But most of all, just not having to worry about work for a bit is going to be very good for me.
