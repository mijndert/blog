- We went on a 5 day trip to a place with lots of playgrounds and a swimming pool for our daughter. Disconnecting from work for a bit was sorely needed for my brain to recover from the insane hours I've been putting in lately. I wouldn't mind to extend by another week or two.
- I'm 4 hours into playing [Cult of the Lamb](https://www.cultofthelamb.com/) on Steam Deck. It's Stardew Valley but with satanic rituals. From the trailers it looked pretty simple, but it actually has a ton of depth.
- I started reading [Extra Focus](https://www.extrafocusbook.com/) by [Jesse J. Anderson](https://adhdjesse.com/). I'm only a few pages in so I'm not sure yet if it's going to be helpful for me, but I'll be taking notes. We'll see.
- With everything that's going on in the world, the government has been telling us to [maybe prepare an emergency kit](https://www.denkvooruit.nl/bereid-je-voor/stel-je-noodpakket-samen). For the past few months I was pretty sceptical, surely war won't reach us? But with the dismantling of the United States and the ongoing aggression by Russia, I'm starting to think it might be a good idea to have some stuff on hand.
