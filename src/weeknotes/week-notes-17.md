Bit of a short week because I posted the previous notes a little later than usual. Still have a couple of things to share.

- Sam's been growing really quickly and he's been making this house his home. He's really used to us and the routine right now. That's not to say everything has been easy; the shark phase and the witching hours are something to behold. But outside of that he's a really sweet, chill dog to have around.
- I haven't been feeling very well this week, both physically and mentally. The combination of work, the new puppy, and other general life stuff is all quite overwhelming. I've been trying to manage my time and energy and make sure I also keep doing stuff for myself. I haven't gone running since Sam's here for example, and I can really feel that. Hope I can get back to a bit of a routine once the dust has settled.
- I'd like to find some time soon to set up this [Garmin Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana). Looks cool, not sure what the value will be but I like the idea of having all this data in a place that I control.
- [Doom The Dark Ages](https://doom.bethesda.net/en-EU/the-dark-ages) is releasing soon and I'm obsessed. I never buy games at full price anymore, so I'll hold off on buying it until it gets a discount. In preperation I've downloaded Doom 2016 onto my Steam Deck. It's so cool playing that game on a portable machine. I get an easy 60fps at medium settings.
