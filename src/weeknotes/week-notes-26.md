Week 26 was full of Kubernetes and getting a lot of work done in a very short amount of time. What else happened?

- Over the weekend my left ear was completely blocked again. I get that a lot, especially in the summer. On Monday I went to the doctors office where they fixed it, it's such a good feeling being able to properly hear again.
- I had to renew our energy contract this week. Weird thing happened where their own system told me to renew at a higher price than what was offered while I was logged out and on the homepage. So I played dumb, signed up for a "new" contract at a lower rate, and low and behold, it worked. Bit scammy, but we're gonna end up paying a bit less so I don't really care too much.
- If I look at our Jira board, I'm kind of amazed at the amount of work I got done this week. Nice to have a productive week like that.
- Speaking about work, this week has been about Kubernetes a lot. I had some upgrades to do, some low level cgroups and runc issues to debug, some networking things to address. Not complaining, I like the challenge and being able to do some actual engineering. These days I don't do a lot of that anymore.
- I wrote about some tips to make [remote working](http://localhost:8080/posts/remote-working-protips/) a bit more enjoyable.
- In terms of gaming, I didn't have a ton of time to play on the Switch 2 but I did manage to play some Halls of Torment on Steam Deck. What I like about it right now is that it has a HUGE number of achievements to unlock which I'm working on right now.
- I also installed a thing called [Greenlight](https://github.com/unknownskl/greenlight) on my Steam Deck which allows me to stream whatever my Xbox would show to the deck. It was easy to get going and works reasonably well. I wouldn't use it for super fast action games, but for slower paced ones it's great.
