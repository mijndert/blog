<h1>Goals for 2025</h1>
<p class="muted">Jan 3, 2025</p>
<article><p>2024 has not been the best year for me and my family. My wife got diagnosed with a chronic illness called MS, which has turned our life upside down in a number of ways. Death has also been a big theme last year. I didn't think I'd already be dealing this much with it at 37, but here we are.</p>
<p>It's been tough and that makes me reconsider a few things. I'm normally not someone who does new years resolutions, and I'm not going to do them now either but I do have some goals in mind for 2025.</p>
<p>I think the overarching theme is going to be about taking care about myself and my family first. I've always been a bit of a people pleaser and I care way too much about other people's opinions. I'm going to try to deal with my own issues only and let others deal with theirs. You know, for my sanity.</p>
<h2>Running</h2>
<p>Running has been a big part of my life in 2024 and I intend to go above and beyond this year. I'm planning to run a few 10k events, again <a href="https://www.msmotion.nl/fundraisers/mijndert-stuij-2">raising funds for MS research</a>. I'm also going back to the half marathon distance which I'm equal parts excited and scared about. The goal is to get close to the 2 hour mark.</p>
<p>The big one is going to be my first ever ultra in November. I have plenty of time left, but it's going to be grind and the biggest challenge yet. Can't wait to cross the finish line.</p>
<h2>Health</h2>
<p>Health wise 2024 wasn't the best with a ton of stress, bad eating habits and just not listening to what my body needed. I'm going to try and listen a little more, take rest when needed, have a healthier diet, cut out late night snacks, drink less alcohol, the works. The ultimate goal is to transform this body into a machine for the aforementioned ultra marathon.</p>
<p>I also have some mental health goals but I don't think I'm ready to talk about those yet. I hope it will make me a more balanced person that understands his own limits and can communicate them better.</p>
<h2>Photography</h2>
<p>Photography has always been a hobby for me - it makes me look at the world differently and makes me consider certain things in a different way. I have this nice Sony camera just collecting dust and I intend to bring it with me more often, where appropriate. I have a certain photographic style in mind which I want to explore some more. When I have something to show for I'll create a photography section on this website.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Despite all the difficulties in my personal life, professionally 2024 has been a year of immense growth. I took on more of a leadership position and I've been working with other leaders in the company; I think technology wise we're in a much better position now. I'm incredibly proud of myself in that regard, it's what I've been working towards for 16 years at this point. In 2025 I'd like to continue this growth and take on even more responsibilities in coaching people, shaping infrastructure and platform architecture, and making sure we're all on the same page.</p>
