<p>Two years ago I got myself my first Garmin watch, the <a href="https://www.garmin.com/nl-NL/p/780139/">Forerunner 255S</a>. I bought it at a heavy discount when the 265 was released. I didn't want to spend too much money on my first Garmin as it's always a bit of a gamble switching ecosystems like that.</p>
<p>I was quite happy with my FR 255 but over the past few weeks it started having some issues. Coincidentally Garmin just released the new <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1464001/">Forerunner 570</a> and after some usual waffling I decided to treat myself to an upgrade and got the 42mm version in black.</p>
<p>I've only had my 570 for about 20 hours so I can't really give a full review, but I suck at those anyway. I do however want to share some initial impressions in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li>The watch is <strong>very</strong> lightweight. This is exactly what I want as my wrists are small and during a run you don't want to have a rock attached to your arm. Not sure about the difference compared to the 255S though.</li>
<li>The screen is absolutely beautiful. The colors really pop off, and the resolution isn't quite <em>retina</em> but it's close enough for my eyes. The 255S had a MIP screen and although outside in direct sunlight it was superior to AMOLED, the colors always looked dull and washed out to me.</li>
<li>I am a little worried about the screen getting scratched since it ever so slightly protrudes past the bezel. But I'm not willing to put a screen protector on so I'll just have to live with the inevitable scratches.</li>
<li>I have to get used to no longer having an always-on display. Yes, it can be enabled on the 570 but I don't want to trade battery life.</li>
<li>I get about 10-11 days on a full charge according to the watch itself. Of course I haven't tested this yet, but these numbers are usually pretty accurate. That's only a 10% decrease compared to the 255S which I think is totally fine for my use. Not an issue, despite people making a really big deal out of it.</li>
<li>The HR sensor on the bottom of the device is way larger than I expected. It's also a little bit more flat though, which is good.</li>
<li>The first hour or so of using the 570 I experienced some lag in the UI. This has since been resolved and everything is quite snappy now. Maybe it needed some time to cache my data.</li>
<li>The vibration motor is a lot stronger which is helpful for silent alarms.</li>
<li>I never thought I'd say this, but I think having a touchscreen is a nice addition. You can disable touch during workouts if you like.</li>
<li>The side buttons are much more clicky compared to the 255S. They're also made out of metal instead of plastic.</li>
<li>Because of the bright colors and the touchscreen, this watch feels way more like a smartwatch.</li>
<li>There's a ton of UI and UX improvements compared to the 255S which make navigating all the menus a lot easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about it, hope it's helpful in some way. I won't do a full review as I don't think I'm qualified for that. <a href="/connect">Let me know</a> which Garmin watch you use and what you think of it.</p>
