<h1>2024 GOTY</h1>
<p class="muted">Dec 20, 2024</p>
<article><p>My gaming habits can be summed up in a single word: erratic. I have a Nintendo Switch and an Xbox Series X just sitting there, collecting dust most of the time. Turning on the tv, powering on the console, waiting for things to update and then finally playing a game just feels like a burden. Espescially the part where the Xbox hogs the tv and my wife can't use it while I play a game. Cumbersome. As a result I didn't really play much on there this year. And yes, I know I can use my Switch as a handheld, but playing it for any significant amount of time makes my hands cramp up. The ergonomics of the Switch are terrible, for me at least. Don't @ me.</p>
<p>I did play a single game on my Xbox though, and it's my GOTY for 2024: <strong>Diablo IV</strong>. Back when the game came out I went through a rough time. My wife ended up in the hospital after she was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and I was left to fend for myself and my daughter for the week. It was the most stressful time I ever experienced and I spent it playing Diablo IV every night until it was time to go to bed. A perfect escape from reality. It's very grindy and works well with my monkey brain because numbers pop out of enemies when I hit them. It's mindless fun, not much skill involved if you don't want to, but it can also be a very deep and difficult game if you're into that. I know there's issues with the game and it's not perfect at all, but for me it was the perfect game at the perfect time.</p>
<p>When the situation started to settle down again though, my Xbox went back to collecting dust as I was focussing on other things that occupied my mind.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I finally pulled the trigger on a Steam Deck that things started to turn around again for gaming. I always found the Steam Deck to be a really interesting device, but I always thought I'd never use it. Just another console that would collect dust, right? I couldn't be more wrong.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck feels more personal, it feels like I'm way more connected to the games I play. I can just pick it up, play for a short session and put it back down again. The ergonomics are way better than the Switch as well; I have zero issues playing for a few hours on end. The games are generally much cheaper compared to the Xbox and Nintendo stores as well, which makes trying a game a bit less prohibitive. I've even been double dipping on games that I already own on Xbox so now I'm back to playing Diablo IV but on Steam Deck instead. It's perfect.</p>
<p>I got my Steam Deck at the end of October and I already played many dozens of hours on it. Some honorable mentions, really all roguelite games, are: Hades II, Vampire Survivors, Brotato and Ballionaire. Every one of these are an incredible time sink and I can't recommend them enough.</p>
<p>Now if you would excuse me, I have some demons to kill and some levels to grind.</p>
