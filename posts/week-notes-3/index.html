<p>New week notes, who dis?</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote about <a href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/the-best-laptop-ever/">my favorite laptop</a> and someone put it up on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42715462">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/y7n6lo/best_laptop_ever">Lobsters</a>. I know I shouldn't read the comments, but I did it anyway. And I came to the conclusion we cannot blame the algorithm for the state of the internet, not for all of it anyway. Even on websites without much of an algorithm, negative comments are still going to reach the top because people love nothing more than engaging with negative content apparently. There were still quite a few positive comments though, so that was nice to see. Not everyone has absolutely lost their minds yet.</li>
<li>I got a <a href="https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-eks-user-guide/pull/828">PR merged</a> on the AWS EKS documentation so that was nice.</li>
<li>In terms of sports, this week was and is a bit better than the previous one. I did some running and rowing, and I will hopefully do some more of that this weekend.</li>
<li>We had some people come over to look at our garage. The plan is to insulate the whole thing, put in a new tile floor, redo the electrical wiring, and put in a new garage door. It's going to be a big and costly project, but I hope it will be worth it in the end.</li>
<li>Work has been chaotic with a lot of things breaking. Didn't have the most fun week ever, but I'm glad we could fix it pretty quickly every time. I'll take the learnings out of these incidents and move on.</li>
<li>After a pretty intense week full of work and other tasks, we're gonna order sushi and watch trash tv tonight. I think we deserve it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for now! Hope you have a wonderful weekend!</p>
