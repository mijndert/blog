    <title>I need to reset my inboxes</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/reset-my-inboxes/" />
    <updated>2025-03-26T14:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/reset-my-inboxes/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt; (GTD) productivity system there&#39;s this concept of an &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt;. People often think of their inbox as just their email, but in GTD an inbox is anything where you collect things that need to be processed. If you&#39;re not careful you&#39;ll quickly end up with too many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look at my phone and laptop I can identify at least 14 inboxes, ranging from email and calendar, to messaging apps and social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is becoming an issue, especially with life and work becoming ever more complex. Every one of these inboxes have to be checked regularly or send a notification by themselves, and every one of them can contain tasks or information that I need to act on or process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer amount of information and tasks that pile up in any of these inboxes is a constant source of distraction and stress. And of course it&#39;s also definitly a &lt;em&gt;me problem&lt;/em&gt;; I have a severe case of FOMO where I sometimes even end up going through a bunch of these apps in rapid succession to see if anything new popped up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s clear that I need a reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I need to &lt;strong&gt;consolidate my inboxes&lt;/strong&gt;. I really don&#39;t need three separate messaging apps, I also don&#39;t need to have both LinkedIn and Instagram installed on my phone. A concrete example are the messaging apps – I have Messages, WhatsApp and Signal installed at the moment. It&#39;s difficult to get everyone on Signal so I&#39;ll try to consolidate as much of my messaging to WhatsApp. I know it&#39;s a Meta product, but sometimes you have to make compromises. Once more people and groups move over to Signal I&#39;ll be in a place to reconsider this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing I need to do is to &lt;strong&gt;set specific times for checking my inboxes&lt;/strong&gt;. I&#39;ll simply put this on my calendar, and I&#39;ll see how this goes. I&#39;ll start with three times a day (morning, lunch, evening) and see if I can later on reduce this to two times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly I need to be way more &lt;strong&gt;mindful of my information intake&lt;/strong&gt;. It&#39;s easy to have a pinned tab for Mastodon and IRC open at all times. All they are doing is distract me from work, costing me a bunch of time I could spend on other things like spending time with my family, running or reading a book.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What a week, lots has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s been a really stressful week at work. Safe to say I need a quiet weekend to recover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the Steam spring sale ended I made sure to pick up &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/&quot;&gt;Halls of Torment&lt;/a&gt; for 4 euro&#39;s. It&#39;s kind of like a mix between oldskool Diablo and Vampire Survivors. Numbers pop up out of enemies and it has a whopping 500 achievements. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The F1 sesaon is underway! Last Sunday I woke up at 5am to watch the Australian GP and it was pure chaos because of the rain. This weekend the Chinese GP is on, I haven&#39;t seen anything yet because of the time difference and work but I&#39;ll catch up later. It&#39;s gonna be a banger of a season!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Tuesday we finally met our Corgi puppy for the first time. We have to wait another 4 weeks now before he can come live with us. His name will be Sam and we&#39;re all very excited to welcome him into the family!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One week left until the 5k event in my town. Due to work and other responsibilities I&#39;m still not running and working out as much as I would like, but the times I have been running have been very promising. Even after this long hiatus I can still run a 27 minute 5k no problem. Really looking forward to the event and on to many more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m gonna enjoy the sunny weather, F1 and some more Halls of Torment. See ya next week&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After many many months of noise coming from our eletric heat pump, I can safely say it&#39;s fixed! I gave the engineer who fixed it a nice bottle of whiskey that&#39;s how happy we are. We can finally sleep at night without turning the heat off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new F1 season is underway with practice sessions in Australia already done. It&#39;s going to be an absolete banger of a season! Hamilton in a Ferrari, Kimi in the Mercedes, McLaren in the mix from the start, some other promising rookies in there. No clue how it&#39;s going to pan out and that excites me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/&quot;&gt;Steam Spring Sale&lt;/a&gt; is here and I finally bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/&quot;&gt;Slay The Spire&lt;/a&gt; to play on my Steam Deck. Everyone kept saying it&#39;s a very addictive game and they... weren&#39;t wrong. I think I&#39;ll stick with this game for a good while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This morning I started running again, I feel like my body and mind are again in a place where I feel like I can do it. Of course I didn&#39;t take it easy because I wanted to benchmark myself a little bit to see where my limit is at currently. I wasn&#39;t disappointed at all, I still have a pretty good base to work off of. Just need to put some kilometers in over the coming weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve signed up for a local 5k on the 30th of March to make sure I keep at it and have a bit of a goal to work towards. I don&#39;t have any specific finishing time in mind, I&#39;m just gonna enjoy this one and use it to get back into the rythm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s about it for this week! Sunday I&#39;m going out for dinner with a friend and next Tuesday we&#39;ll finally meet the Corgi puppies! Can&#39;t wait. See ya then!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Week notes 10</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-10/" />
    <updated>2025-03-07T13:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-10/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quite a few updates to share this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weather has been absolutely amazing these past few days. It&#39;s finally sunny and warm and nature is waking up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&#39;ve made some good progress on the project to insulate the garage. We finally have a pretty good game plan and we can close on some deals to make it happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another thing that&#39;s finally out of the way (I hope, let&#39;s wait another few days) is the trouble we&#39;ve been having with our electric heat pump. When it&#39;s cold outside, it would make this terrible noise that kept us up at night. After many visits from technicians, it seems to be fixed now. And of course the fix was relatively simple, it just took a long while to figure out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven&#39;t been running for almost 3 months now. I&#39;ve been very busy with work and due to everything else going on in my life I haven&#39;t been feeling great both physically and mentally. I&#39;m really hoping I feel well enough soon to pick running back up because I have an event coming up in May.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve been enjoying &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/fusq&quot;&gt;Fusq&lt;/a&gt; while working this week. I don&#39;t think why but it works really well with my brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefox 136 is released and it has vertical tabs! The design is really well done in my opinion. I would highly recommend you check it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonight we&#39;ll be binge-watching the new season of Drive to Survive on Netflix. And on Saturday I have a poker session planned with some friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday and enjoy the weather!&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-9/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What a week, huh? It&#39;s been a quick one again, with a lot of work done and a lot of things happening. Here are some highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a call with a breeder we are now officially on the list for a Corgi puppy. After years and years of waiting and dreaming it&#39;s finally happening, or so I hope. We&#39;re gonna meet the puppies in about 3 weeks time and we&#39;ll see how that goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m currently re-reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://matthewquirk.com/the-night-agent/&quot;&gt;The Night Agent by Matthew Quirk&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve seen the tv show but honestly the book is better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also started reading Bill Gates&#39; new memoir &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesnotes.com/meet-bill/source-code&quot;&gt;Source Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2025 F1 season is underway with 3 days of testing. Of course, nothing can be gleaned from testing, but it&#39;s nice to see the cars out on track again. It&#39;s going to be a tight field with some rookies that are very promising as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I&#39;ll leave you with another song. Blues legend Buddy Guy and one of my favorite bands Switchfoot released a single together called Last Man Standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;spotify-track-1ra4PQfZO9AbLTT0V8xu1D&quot; class=&quot;eleventy-plugin-embed-spotify eleventy-plugin-embed-spotify-track&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;border-radius:12px;&quot; title=&quot;Spotify track&quot; src=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1ra4PQfZO9AbLTT0V8xu1D&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Practice optimism with a single question</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/practice-optimism-w-single-question/" />
    <updated>2025-02-26T10:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/practice-optimism-w-single-question/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People that know me well will tell you that I&#39;m not the most optimistic person in the world. I tend to see the negatives in things rather than the positives. I&#39;m not proud of it of course, but it&#39;s something &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/now/&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve been working&lt;/a&gt; on for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I vouched to try to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stephango.com/optimism&quot;&gt;default to optimism&lt;/a&gt; and see the good in things and situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Steph Ango put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of a pessimist is easy but dreary. The life of an optimist is hard but exciting. Pessimism is easy because it costs nothing. Optimism is hard because it must be constantly reaffirmed. In the face of a hostile, cynical world, it takes effort to show that positivity has merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a family we unintentionally started a bit of a tradition. Every night at dinner we ask each other &amp;quot;what was the most fun thing that happened today?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single question that helps us reflect on the day and focus on the positives. Our daughter loves it as well and it&#39;s a great way to get her to talk about her day. It&#39;s also a great way for me to practice optimism. Lastly it really helps with gratitude and storytelling skills – making you think a little harder about what transpired during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Week notes 8</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-8/" />
    <updated>2025-02-21T11:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-8/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week I finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extrafocusbook.com/&quot;&gt;Extra Focus&lt;/a&gt;. For me personally there wasn&#39;t a ton of new information in there, but it was nice to get some extra validation for all of the things I&#39;ve been experiencing over the years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the extra responsibilities I&#39;m given at work are starting to materialize. It&#39;s a busy but very exciting time right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve been going back to writing notes, todo items and other things on paper in a little notebook. The problem however is that it&#39;s very hard to keep it somewhat organized. I&#39;m currently thinking about how I can best tackle this problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about quantum computers for almost 30 years at this point. This week Microsoft &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSHmygPQukQ&quot;&gt;announced a new process&lt;/a&gt; for creating a scalable error-corrected quantum chip. Obviously that&#39;s all very exciting. We need quantum computers to build better quantum computers, so in a few years time this innovation will only accelerate exponentially.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through the Welsh Corgi Club here in The Netherlands I enquired about getting a Corgi puppy. We&#39;ve been dreaming about this for almost 8 years and we&#39;re finally in a position to make it happen.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Oops, I bought it</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/oops-i-bought-it/" />
    <updated>2025-02-18T15:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/oops-i-bought-it/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember me &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/display-waffling/&quot;&gt;waffling about computer monitors&lt;/a&gt;? That was just six weeks ago. I have a confession to make: I bought it (yes this was shared in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-5/&quot;&gt;week notes 5&lt;/a&gt; already, but I have some more things to say now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I wouldn&#39;t recommend anyone else do this, unless you&#39;ve got a bunch of money to squander. I certainly don&#39;t, usually. But unexpectedly, I received some extra money to spend and I decided to treat myself for once. I&#39;m always very good at convincing myself that I don&#39;t need the thing I actually really want to have. But this time, after much deliberation, I decided to go for it. And boy, is it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dell U4025QW is by far the best monitor I&#39;ve ever owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It came packaged in probably one of the biggest piles of cardboard I&#39;ve ever seen. The mark of a good quality product I guess. The entire unboxing experience was really easy and my new 40 inch 5k 120hz monitor was up and running on my desk in no time at all. Getting rid of the giant mountain of cardboard was the hardest part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about those specs: they don&#39;t matter. There are other monitors with similar specs and they don&#39;t matter either. What does matter is the sharpness of the text, the color reproduction, the insane ports selection, the build quality... I could gush over this thing for hours. My favorite thing is this little pop-out thing that has 1x USB-A and 2x USB-C, easily accessible on the front. Why didn&#39;t others think of this? Another really convenient thing is the ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts the monitor&#39;s brightness. I didn&#39;t expect it to work very well, but it totally does!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wanted to update ya&#39;ll on my waffling. I&#39;m a total hypocrite for buying it anyway. Not that I feel sorry about it, I&#39;m rather pleased with my purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We went on a 5 day trip to a place with lots of playgrounds and a swimming pool for our daughter. Disconnecting from work for a bit was sorely needed for my brain to recover from the insane hours I&#39;ve been putting in lately. I wouldn&#39;t mind to extend by another week or two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m 4 hours into playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultofthelamb.com/&quot;&gt;Cult of the Lamb&lt;/a&gt; on Steam Deck. It&#39;s Stardew Valley but with satanic rituals. From the trailers it looked pretty simple, but it actually has a ton of depth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extrafocusbook.com/&quot;&gt;Extra Focus&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://adhdjesse.com/&quot;&gt;Jesse J. Anderson&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;m only a few pages in so I&#39;m not sure yet if it&#39;s going to be helpful for me, but I&#39;ll be taking notes. We&#39;ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With everything that&#39;s going on in the world, the government has been telling us to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.denkvooruit.nl/bereid-je-voor/stel-je-noodpakket-samen&quot;&gt;maybe prepare an emergency kit&lt;/a&gt;. For the past few months I was pretty sceptical, surely war won&#39;t reach us? But with the dismantling of the United States and the ongoing aggression by Russia, I&#39;m starting to think it might be a good idea to have some stuff on hand.&lt;/li&gt;

    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-6/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bit of a boring week (again) with not much going on. I was mainly working a lot to finish everything before I&#39;m off for a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I focussed on getting our backups in a better shape. All of our photos are stored in iCloud, but they&#39;re also now going to the Synology NAS automatically via the Synology Photos app. I&#39;ve also set up a backup of the NAS to Backblaze for around $6/month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to see a couple of friends and we played some boardgames together. It was nice seeing them again and getting out of the house for a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Wednesday I went to the office and had a pretty productive day there. Still takes almost 3 hours for a one way trip, though. I always need to recover the day after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The list of things I want to write about is ever growing but I just haven&#39;t found the time yet. I won&#39;t promise anything, just expect some more of these week notes with nothing else in between while I get on top of other stuff first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next week we&#39;ll go an a little vacation for a few days. I expect lots of swimming, reading, relaxing and eating. But most of all, just not having to worry about work for a bit is going to be very good for me.&lt;/li&gt;

    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-5/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New (not so) boring week, new notes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 37 years of stumbling through life I got &lt;em&gt;unofficially&lt;/em&gt; diagnosed with ADHD. I&#39;m now thinking of requesting an official diagnosis, but I&#39;m not sure yet what that will bring me. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s impacting my performance at work or anything, every employer I&#39;ve worked with has been really happy. Anyway, it&#39;s good to know I&#39;m not totally crazy or stupid, and my suspicions were right all these years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently finishing up another crazy week at work. But it&#39;s a really good chance to step up as a leader more and more. I&#39;m very much enjoying the challenge and the career growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, didn&#39;t get to do any running or rowing this week because of everything that&#39;s been going on. I&#39;m just too tired in the evenings to do anything. I hope to pick it back up again soon because my Garmin watch is screaming at me. I&#39;m starting to sound like a broken record. Moving on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yesterday my new computer display (Dell U4025QW) arrived. It was the most frivolous purchase I&#39;ve ever made but I&#39;m so happy. Everything looks so crisp, the port selection is insane, the build quality is really good, the light sensor is super useful and works very well. It&#39;s my dream display. I&#39;ll put a photo of my current setup down below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This weekend we&#39;ll meet up with some friends we haven&#39;t seen in a while to play boardgames. I&#39;m terrible at boardgames but I&#39;m looking forward to seeing our friends again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/img/q64y9w3F8G-300.webp 300w, https://mijndertstuij.nl/img/q64y9w3F8G-500.webp 500w, https://mijndertstuij.nl/img/q64y9w3F8G-800.webp 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;90vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/img/q64y9w3F8G-300.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;My WFH setup in 2025&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;524&quot; srcset=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/img/q64y9w3F8G-300.jpeg 300w, https://mijndertstuij.nl/img/q64y9w3F8G-500.jpeg 500w, https://mijndertstuij.nl/img/q64y9w3F8G-800.jpeg 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;90vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll leave you with a YouTube recommendation. Even when she worked at The Verge I would watch all of her videos, every last one of them. But now she&#39;s gone independent and her videos are somehow even better. I&#39;m talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@BeccaFarsace/videos&quot;&gt;Becca Farsace&lt;/a&gt;. She takes tech outside. Go watch her videos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Week notes 4</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the year of week notes on the desktop! (if you know, you know)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My position at work involves a lot of non-technical work like talking to people and vendors, filling out spreadsheets, doing presentations. Which is all great, but I&#39;m a nerd at heart so I allowed myself some time to do some engineering work this week. I really have to carve out more time for that kind of stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a company-wide kick-off event, I presented how the tech team is going to contribute to the overall goal of the company for 2025 and beyond. I was a little nervous to present in front of 100+ people, but I got some really nice compliments afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ellie.wtf/&quot;&gt;Ellie&lt;/a&gt; has given me access to try &lt;a href=&quot;https://atuin.sh/&quot;&gt;Atuin&lt;/a&gt; Desktop and it&#39;s just incredible. It&#39;s still early days so it&#39;s all a little rough around the edges, but the potential is definitly there. I&#39;ll be sharing some more thoughts in a separate post soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the inauguration of the Orange Man, I decided to filter out a ton of words on Mastodon. My timeline is now a happy place once more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last time I talked about how we&#39;re planning to have some work done to our garage. We received the first quote and &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt; is it a lot of money. I kind of expected it, but not &lt;em&gt;this much&lt;/em&gt;. Anyway, we have a few more quotes coming in so we&#39;ll see how it goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today I brought in my car for maintenance. Fingers crossed nothing unexpected pops up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it! Bit of a quiet week this one. Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The algorithm isn&#39;t always to blame</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/the-algorithm-not-always-to-blame/" />
    <updated>2025-01-20T12:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/the-algorithm-not-always-to-blame/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone is a victim of The Algorithm in one way or another. I&#39;m still on Instagram (yes, I know) and I quite often fall into the trap of looking at Reels (super short videos) for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t even like most of the content it shows me, but I keep swiping just in case the next one is something funny. The algorithm is really good at recognizing when I&#39;m looking at a video of a golden retriever for 3 seconds longer than usual. I will get a bunch of other golden retriever videos and suddenly it will cut to something else entirely, lest I get bored and quit the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, showing a user videos of golden retrievers is a benign use of an algorithm. The algorithm is also used to get you hooked onto extreme, dangerous content. Our brains love nothing more than engaging with content that gets us angry, scared, sad, or anxious. All to make us pay attention for longer, because eyeballs sell ads and ads are the lifeblood of these companies. They are using our psychology against us to make a buck, and it&#39;s working incredibly well. Thousands of people are working every day to exploit our brains in better, more efficient ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s this algortihm that is (partly) to blame for the state of the world today where people are more divided than ever. Big tech became politicized; it&#39;s no longer about the truth, it&#39;s about what gets the most clicks, the most eyeballs, the most ad revenue. People are acting dumb willingly, all to get that precious attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is the algorithm to blame for all of these problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/the-best-laptop-ever/&quot;&gt;my favorite laptop&lt;/a&gt; and someone put it up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42715462&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lobste.rs/s/y7n6lo/best_laptop_ever&quot;&gt;Lobsters&lt;/a&gt;. Both HN and Lobsters don&#39;t have much in the way of an algorithm - they rank stories based on newness, amount of comments in a certain timeframe, and upvotes. Again, people love nothing more than interacting with negative content and, even without an algorithm, the negativity still spread like wildfire and reached the top so more people felt the need to chime in. The result was a whopping 140+ comments on the Lobsters thread which are insane numbers on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s easy to blame to algorithm for the flood of negative, harmful shit that&#39;s spread out over the internet nowadays. It puts the blame on a thing we have no control over, instead of on ourselves. But maybe, instead of leaving a comment on something you have no affinity with, you should ask yourself &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;is what I have to say going to add anything of value?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; and if the answer is no, maybe just don&#39;t comment? If you don&#39;t care at all about Mac hardware, you can quite safely ignore all content that&#39;s about Mac hardware. It will save you and everyone else a bunch of time and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Week notes 3</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New week notes, who dis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/the-best-laptop-ever/&quot;&gt;my favorite laptop&lt;/a&gt; and someone put it up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42715462&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lobste.rs/s/y7n6lo/best_laptop_ever&quot;&gt;Lobsters&lt;/a&gt;. I know I shouldn&#39;t read the comments, but I did it anyway. And I came to the conclusion we cannot blame the algorithm for the state of the internet, not for all of it anyway. Even on websites without much of an algorithm, negative comments are still going to reach the top because people love nothing more than engaging with negative content apparently. There were still quite a few positive comments though, so that was nice to see. Not everyone has absolutely lost their minds yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-eks-user-guide/pull/828&quot;&gt;PR merged&lt;/a&gt; on the AWS EKS documentation so that was nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of sports, this week was and is a bit better than the previous one. I did some running and rowing, and I will hopefully do some more of that this weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had some people come over to look at our garage. The plan is to insulate the whole thing, put in a new tile floor, redo the electrical wiring, and put in a new garage door. It&#39;s going to be a big and costly project, but I hope it will be worth it in the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work has been chaotic with a lot of things breaking. Didn&#39;t have the most fun week ever, but I&#39;m glad we could fix it pretty quickly every time. I&#39;ll take the learnings out of these incidents and move on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a pretty intense week full of work and other tasks, we&#39;re gonna order sushi and watch trash tv tonight. I think we deserve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for now! Hope you have a wonderful weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop ever</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/the-best-laptop-ever/" />
    <updated>2025-01-15T16:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/the-best-laptop-ever/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A laptop for just €950 is bound to be crappy, have some issues, and not last very long. Or so you’d think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought my M1 MacBook Air — just the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage — somewhere in mid 2021 to use as a couch computer for, you read that right, just €950 on sale. I like having a strict separation between work and personal use, and the 15&amp;quot; MacBook Pro we had before was plagued by the dreaded keyboard issue. Also, using a 15&amp;quot; laptop on the couch is far from comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the MacBook Air — what a machine. Granted, I only use it for light web development, browsing, emails, and occasionally running a small Docker container. But that’s not much different from what I do for work. I could literally do my job on this tiny little laptop. The keyboard is clicky, the webcam is... fine, the screen is Retina and beautiful, the battery lasts forever, and it’s eerily quiet because it doesn’t have any moving parts. It just keeps chugging along, never slows down or gets hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For work, I have a 14&amp;quot; MacBook Pro with an M2 Pro, 16GB of RAM, and 500GB of storage. But &lt;em&gt;for my use&lt;/em&gt;, I don’t really notice a difference between the two. Yes, the screen on the M2 is much nicer, but does that even matter? I guess if you’re doing a lot of photo or video editing, sure. But for me, it just displays text in Ghostty or VS Code, and almost any monitor can handle that just fine. I guess I’m not a &lt;em&gt;pro user&lt;/em&gt; according to Apple’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price difference is over €1000! Yes, the M2 is a good laptop — it’s fast and stable, has more ports and it has a lot more performance — but it’s not €1000 better than my M1 Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can already hear you shouting from the rooftops &lt;em&gt;“I could never do my job with just 8GB of RAM!”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“256GB of storage would fill up so quickly!”&lt;/em&gt; — and you’d probably be right. But I’ve never hit those limits. With a machine this affordable, you sort of reprogram yourself to live within its boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could keep going about specs and how it compares to a MacBook Pro, but here’s the thing: this is by far my favorite laptop ever. It’s cheap, it does the job, it’s light, it’s quiet, and it’s beautiful. I love it, and I can’t see myself replacing it unless the battery dies, I drop it and the screen cracks, or some other terrible thing happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love affordable tech that just does its job and gets out of the way. That’s also why I bought a Garmin FR 255 on sale for just €280. Sure, there are better ones out there, but this does everything I need. The same goes for my Kobo e-reader, which I also got on sale. Again, there were better models available, and the technology has advanced, so there are much nicer ones now. When you buy something afforable, you don’t have to worry about it as much. You can just use it and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need the latest and greatest. I just need a tool that works. My MacBook Air is exactly that, and it’s the best laptop ever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blog questions challenge</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/blog-questions-challenge/" />
    <updated>2025-01-13T14:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/blog-questions-challenge/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Why did you start blogging in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog has taken on many forms over the years, but the main theme was always sharing technical content that others might find useful. Some things that I&#39;ve learned, some bug I&#39;ve solved, some tools I discovered. I am and forever will be a firm believer that knowledge should be freely available for anyone. What I did find though, was that keeping the technical content up to date was a hassle so I decided to dial that back a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I write about whatever comes to mind and I recently started sharing week notes which has done wonders for my creativity, mental health and output on this blog as well. I just love having my own &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt; on the internet that I can do anything with. I don&#39;t need to ask for permission and my name is attached to it, not some large corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also has changed over the years, but I&#39;m currently all in on Eleventy and I love everything about it. I love static websites for their speed and myriad hosting options it gives me. Eleventy has a very good plug-in ecosystem as well and the community is super friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog is hosted on GitHub Pages. All details can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/colophon&quot;&gt;colophon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Have you blogged on other platforms before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, many changes over the years. I started out on WordPress, was active on Tumblr for a while, switched to Jekyll, then to Hugo and now on Eleventy. I also tried Ghost in the past but quickly found it didn&#39;t suit my needs very well. I just want the tool to get out of the way as much as possible now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that&#39;s part of your blog?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write my posts in Visual Studio Code and I preview them locally using Eleventy&#39;s built-in server. I just copy over one of the Markdown files in &lt;code&gt;src/posts&lt;/code&gt; and start writing. Nothing fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. When do you feel most inspired to write?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow a ton of different independent blogs in my RSS reader where I come across so many good posts that inspire me all the time. When my brain gets some downtime that&#39;s when I find myself thinking about what I could write about next. I either write immediately when I&#39;m at my desk, or I add it to my Reminders app for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I publish immediately because most times I&#39;m pretty excited to share what I&#39;ve written and I love getting feedback. I do proofread but I still have to go back and add a few more commits to fix the odd spelling mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. What&#39;s your favorite post on your blog?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/2025-goals/&quot;&gt;Goals for 2025&lt;/a&gt; as it guides me through the year. A technical topic I still really like is &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/avoid-using-internal-load-balancers/&quot;&gt;Avoid using internal load balancers&lt;/a&gt; because it saved me a ton of time as an AWS consultant back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just redesigned my blog and I&#39;m happy with it for now. I do want to eventually add a photography section on here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Week notes 2</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-2/" />
    <updated>2025-01-10T09:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-2/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Week notes 2 already? Feels like I just wrote the first one. If time keeps flying by like this, it will be a very short year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&#39;t do much running this week unfortunately as life got in the way. Maybe next week will be better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work has slowly started picking up again now that everyone&#39;s coming back from their holiday break. We&#39;ve got a pretty good roadmap ahead of us and I&#39;m excited to get stuck in!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m getting some extra responsibilities at work soon which I&#39;m pretty excited about as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We haven&#39;t seen the sun much over the past couple of weeks, but starting today we&#39;ll have a few days of clear skies. It&#39;s cold though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I kept on playing Diablo IV, trying to transform my Spiritborn into an endgame build and hitting at least 200 paragon before this season ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote down a few ideas for more blog posts which are coming soon. I&#39;m trying to spread it out a little bit so I don&#39;t run out of things to write about and I don&#39;t want to spam your RSS readers either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Received some lovely blogs to read after my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/ill-read-it/&quot;&gt;call to send them my way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it! See ya next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think with the ever growing power of mega corporations on the internet, writing a personal blog is a good way to keep the internet weird. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s about personal experiences, some very specific topic, or just random thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s difficult to keep writing and come up with topics to write about, more so when you feel like no one is reading along. Manuel is motivating people to start writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it&quot;&gt;by offering to read their blog&lt;/a&gt; so you have your first reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;d like to join Manuel in this effort. If you have a blog, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mijndert@mijndertstuij.nl&quot;&gt;send it to me&lt;/a&gt; and I will read it. Even better if you add an RSS feed so I can easily keep track of new posts. I like reading in English or Dutch, any and all topics are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Display waffling</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/display-waffling/" />
    <updated>2025-01-07T06:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/display-waffling/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think almost any nerd remembers their first computer monitor. Mine was a tiny CRT one that could only display a few lines of amber text. It was hooked up to an Intel 8086 I think and even though it was very outdated at the time already, it was my very first personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, by now I&#39;ve owned well over a dozen different computer monitors. Needs and preferences change, so you end up buying something else every few years because you think it will serve your needs or wants better than what you had before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When COVID hit, we had 2 separate desks set up with 27 inch 4k displays. My wife needed a bit more space for her work and I didn&#39;t want to get into the trouble of having a multi-monitor setup. More so because we have wildly different tastes in computers and trying to connect it all in a manner that works for the both of us would have meant I also needed to buy a dock of sorts, adding to the cost. Instead, we opted for a single ultrawide display, the Dell P3421W. I continued working on my 27 inch 4k display and she got the ultrawide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I know, once you go ultrawide you can never really go back. I&#39;m not all about &amp;quot;productivity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;workflow&amp;quot; but the extra horizontal space means I can have my code editor and my terminal side-by-side very comfortably. By chance, we got a second ultrawide for free from someone who didn&#39;t use it and apparently didn&#39;t care about its monetary value. It was an HP Z38C that offered even more vertical space than our Dell monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the present. I&#39;ve been using the HP monitor for the longest time now since I work remote and I want a nice monitor because I have to look at it for 40+ hours a week. Thing is, when you look at a computer monitor for that much time, you start to notice its tiny flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the new Dell U4025QW appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I didn&#39;t buy it (yet?) but I read about it on RTINGS or whatever and immediatly put it on my wishlist. A 40 inch 5k2k ultrawide monitor that costs a whopping €1800. I would still run it at 1600p but the added pixels would mean text would be extra crispy. Do I need it? Absolutely not. Do I want it? Absolutely yes. I mean, it has all the ports, it has a little pop out thingy with even more ports! It&#39;s an Ultrasharp so the colors are supposed to be very good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something unexpected happened with the HP Z38C though. My MacBook Pro ran out of battery even though it was supposed to be hooked up to USB-C. Turns out, if you don&#39;t use the extra fancy HP cable that comes with DRM, you only get 15 watts of power delivery. That annoyed the hell out of me so I took it out of my office and got the Dell P3421W back from retirement. I hooked it up to my MacBook, got 65 watts of power delivery and I&#39;m back in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I noticed: the colors are way more vibrant than on the HP, apparently the HP was always a bit washed out. Another thing I noticed is that the Dell isn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much smaller. In fact, I think I actually prefer a smaller monitor. I&#39;m someone who can&#39;t focus on anything at all, so multitasking never works for me, I just want my terminal and code editor side-by-side please. I don&#39;t need a 40 inch 5k2k monitor, what I need was sitting in my attic all along. Sure, it&#39;s not perfect: uniformity is a bit off, the text isn&#39;t as crisp as I would like, it doesn&#39;t have enough useful ports... But it doesn&#39;t cost €1800 either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the U4025QW is on my wishlist just in case. Maybe a smaller version of that monitor will come along some day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Goals for 2025</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/2025-goals/" />
    <updated>2025-01-03T14:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/2025-goals/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2024 has not been the best year for me and my family. My wife got diagnosed with a chronic illness called MS, which has turned our life upside down in a number of ways. Death has also been a big theme last year. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d already be dealing this much with it at 37, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been tough and that makes me reconsider a few things. I&#39;m normally not someone who does new years resolutions, and I&#39;m not going to do them now either but I do have some goals in mind for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the overarching theme is going to be about taking care about myself and my family first. I&#39;ve always been a bit of a people pleaser and I care way too much about other people&#39;s opinions. I&#39;m going to try to deal with my own issues only and let others deal with theirs. You know, for my sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running has been a big part of my life in 2024 and I intend to go above and beyond this year. I&#39;m planning to run a few 10k events, again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msmotion.nl/fundraisers/mijndert-stuij-2&quot;&gt;raising funds for MS research&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;m also going back to the half marathon distance which I&#39;m equal parts excited and scared about. The goal is to get close to the 2 hour mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big one is going to be my first ever ultra in November. I have plenty of time left, but it&#39;s going to be grind and the biggest challenge yet. Can&#39;t wait to cross the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health wise 2024 wasn&#39;t the best with a ton of stress, bad eating habits and just not listening to what my body needed. I&#39;m going to try and listen a little more, take rest when needed, have a healthier diet, cut out late night snacks, drink less alcohol, the works. The ultimate goal is to transform this body into a machine for the aforementioned ultra marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have some mental health goals but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready to talk about those yet. I hope it will make me a more balanced person that understands his own limits and can communicate them better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography has always been a hobby for me - it makes me look at the world differently and makes me consider certain things in a different way. I have this nice Sony camera just collecting dust and I intend to bring it with me more often, where appropriate. I have a certain photographic style in mind which I want to explore some more. When I have something to show for I&#39;ll create a photography section on this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the difficulties in my personal life, professionally 2024 has been a year of immense growth. I took on more of a leadership position and I&#39;ve been working with other leaders in the company; I think technology wise we&#39;re in a much better position now. I&#39;m incredibly proud of myself in that regard, it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been working towards for 16 years at this point. In 2025 I&#39;d like to continue this growth and take on even more responsibilities in coaching people, shaping infrastructure and platform architecture, and making sure we&#39;re all on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Week notes 1</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-1/" />
    <updated>2025-01-02T10:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/week-notes-1/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my first ever entry in a new series. Just about every blog I follow does these week notes where they summarize what they&#39;ve been up to. It&#39;s often very personal, sometimes it&#39;s about work or games or music. I always get something out of reading them, so I thought I&#39;d give it a try myself. There&#39;s no particular format or structure and I&#39;m trying to figure things out as I go. Bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally I&#39;d publish these things on a Friday, but I just got back to work today and I wanted to get this out there. Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was off work for almost 2 weeks which was the longest stretch of not having to think about work in a long long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Years eve was rather uneventful. We stayed home because most other people we regulary hang out with during NYE had other plans. Maybe next year...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ghostty.org/&quot;&gt;Ghostty&lt;/a&gt; is my new terminal emulator and it runs great. Love the defaults so &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mijndert/dotfiles/blob/main/ghostty_config&quot;&gt;my config&lt;/a&gt; is just 3 lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I double dipped and bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/&quot;&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt; again for my Steam Deck. Doesn&#39;t run great in endgame, but good enough to be enjoyable. Having a blast with the new class. Already put in well over 20 hours again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This website got quite a large refresh in terms of its design. I&#39;m very happy with the result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 2 months of being sedentary I got back into the habit of running. Planning to run a few events this year, with some 10k and 21k distances in there. The big one is going to be a 50k in November. Back to the grind!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still thinking of some new years resolutions, nothing is set in stone yet. I&#39;m not going to make my life very hard or anything - I just want a quiet year with a bigger focus on myself and what my body needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been listening to one of my favorite bands &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.switchfoot.com/&quot;&gt;Switchfoot&lt;/a&gt; quite a bit after a long stretch of not listening to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it! I&#39;ll leave you with a playlist to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;spotify-playlist-37i9dQZF1DZ06evO43TWtq&quot; class=&quot;eleventy-plugin-embed-spotify eleventy-plugin-embed-spotify-playlist&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;border-radius:12px;&quot; title=&quot;Spotify playlist&quot; src=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO43TWtq&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>2024 GOTY</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/2024-goty/" />
    <updated>2024-12-20T10:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/2024-goty/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My gaming habits can be summed up in a single word: erratic. I have a Nintendo Switch and an Xbox Series X just sitting there, collecting dust most of the time. Turning on the tv, powering on the console, waiting for things to update and then finally playing a game just feels like a burden. Espescially the part where the Xbox hogs the tv and my wife can&#39;t use it while I play a game. Cumbersome. As a result I didn&#39;t really play much on there this year. And yes, I know I can use my Switch as a handheld, but playing it for any significant amount of time makes my hands cramp up. The ergonomics of the Switch are terrible, for me at least. Don&#39;t @ me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did play a single game on my Xbox though, and it&#39;s my GOTY for 2024: &lt;strong&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/strong&gt;. Back when the game came out I went through a rough time. My wife ended up in the hospital after she was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and I was left to fend for myself and my daughter for the week. It was the most stressful time I ever experienced and I spent it playing Diablo IV every night until it was time to go to bed. A perfect escape from reality. It&#39;s very grindy and works well with my monkey brain because numbers pop out of enemies when I hit them. It&#39;s mindless fun, not much skill involved if you don&#39;t want to, but it can also be a very deep and difficult game if you&#39;re into that. I know there&#39;s issues with the game and it&#39;s not perfect at all, but for me it was the perfect game at the perfect time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the situation started to settle down again though, my Xbox went back to collecting dust as I was focussing on other things that occupied my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t until I finally pulled the trigger on a Steam Deck that things started to turn around again for gaming. I always found the Steam Deck to be a really interesting device, but I always thought I&#39;d never use it. Just another console that would collect dust, right? I couldn&#39;t be more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steam Deck feels more personal, it feels like I&#39;m way more connected to the games I play. I can just pick it up, play for a short session and put it back down again. The ergonomics are way better than the Switch as well; I have zero issues playing for a few hours on end. The games are generally much cheaper compared to the Xbox and Nintendo stores as well, which makes trying a game a bit less prohibitive. I&#39;ve even been double dipping on games that I already own on Xbox so now I&#39;m back to playing Diablo IV but on Steam Deck instead. It&#39;s perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my Steam Deck at the end of October and I already played many dozens of hours on it. Some honorable mentions, really all roguelite games, are: Hades II, Vampire Survivors, Brotato and Ballionaire. Every one of these are an incredible time sink and I can&#39;t recommend them enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you would excuse me, I have some demons to kill and some levels to grind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a fun new thing in the blogosphere: sharing your default apps. I saw a few people I follow do it and borrowed the format, as one does. A ton more pages like this to look at are catalogued by &lt;a href=&quot;https://defaults.rknight.me/&quot;&gt;Robb Knight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always been a minimalist since having too much &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; doesn&#39;t fit in my brain. The same is true on my electronic devices; having too many apps gives me a headache. As a result, this might be a rather boring list for most people, but I&#39;m eager to see how it evolves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Config-driven Terraform</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/config-driven-terraform/" />
    <updated>2024-01-18T10:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/config-driven-terraform/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/terraform-import-blocks/&quot;&gt;config-driven import&lt;/a&gt; which became available in Terraform 1.5. Import blocks are a way to import existing resources into the statefile, which is useful when you have a bunch of infrastructure that was created manually. Yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-7-adds-test-mocking-and-config-driven-remove&quot;&gt;Terraform 1.7 was released&lt;/a&gt; that extends this functionality with a &lt;code&gt;for_each&lt;/code&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraform 1.7 also includes an enhancement for config-driven import: the ability to expand import blocks using for_each loops. Previously you could target a particular instance of a resource in the to attribute of an import block, but you had to write a separate import block for each instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding on my previous blogpost about Import blocks, here&#39;s a quick example of how to use the new &lt;code&gt;for_each&lt;/code&gt; argument on a list to import multiple Digitalocean Spaces buckets at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-hcl&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-hcl&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;terraform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;required_providers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;digitalocean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;digitalocean/digitalocean&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;locals&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;buckets&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bucket-test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;staging&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bucket-staging&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;prod&quot;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bucket-prod&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;for_each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; local.buckets
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; digitalocean_spaces_bucket.mybucket&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;each.key&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;resource &lt;span class=&quot;token type variable&quot;&gt;&quot;digitalocean_spaces_bucket&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;mybucket&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;for_each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; local.buckets
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;bucket&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; each.value
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great addition in Terraform 1.7 are Remove blocks. There are times when you need to remove a resource from your Statefile, optionally without removing the underlying resource itself. Of course there are CLI commands to accomplish this, but having it available as a Remove block means we can run &lt;code&gt;terraform apply&lt;/code&gt; and check the changes before executing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to the terraform state rm command, the removed block addresses all of these challenges. Just like the moved and import blocks, state removal can now be performed in bulk and is plannable, so you can be confident that the operation will have the intended effect before modifying state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-hcl&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-hcl&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; digitalocean_spaces_bucket.mybucket

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Instruct Terraform not to destroy the underlying resource&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;lifecycle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;destroy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these additions are great improvements to Terraform, and I&#39;m looking forward to using them in my projects. They will ensure I&#39;m much more confident in working with the Statefile which has always been a bit daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On running with a watch</title>
    <link href="https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/running-with-a-watch/" />
    <updated>2023-12-08T10:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://mijndertstuij.nl/posts/running-with-a-watch/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyone that knows me well can attest to me being a dreadful sports person in almost every category; except for one: running. I&#39;ve been running for a very long time, I could at one point run a 5k in 20 minutes and a 10k in less than 50 minutes. I never really had a plan, I just go out for a run and don&#39;t think about it too much. To the chagrin of some of my friends, running comes natural to me. I naturally have a rather high vo2max and I&#39;m not super prone to injuries so I can just keep running for a good while before I hit my limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of all this, I never had a use-case for a better watch than my Apple Watch SE. But as I get older I do need a little more hand holding to get my old form back. I finally decided to get a Garmin Forerunner 255S and I&#39;ve been using it for 2 weeks now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, there&#39;s absolutely no way to compare an Apple Watch to a Garmin Forerunnner. They are for completely different use-cases. The Apple Watch is a smart watch with some fitness features, the Garmin is a fitness watch with some smart features. That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t wear my Garmin throughout the day, on the contrary; I wear it as much as possible to give it as much information as I can. I even use it to track my sleep, which is something I never did with my Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that&#39;s incomparable between the two is the ease of use and the user interface. My new Garmin has an app called Garmin Connect and the UI just isn&#39;t as pretty. Because of the UI the entire experience takes a while to get used to, factor in the huge amount of data that&#39;s being collected and presented in the app, and you have a recipe for a steep learning curve. Luckily every single metric has a &#39;help&#39; button which describes exactly what it is and why I should care about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like most about the Garmin as compared to the Apple Watch is how well it ties all the data together to create a comprehensive overview of how your training is affecting you and your overall health. Something the Apple Watch did not do, it just showed you all the individual data points and left it up to you to figure out what it all meant. It really does take out all the guesswork out of training for say a half marathon which I&#39;m doing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of training, the Garmin does give me daily suggestions on what I should be doing that day. Today I got a recommendation to do interval sprints, and tomorrow is long run day. Due to personal circumstances I can&#39;t always follow the recommendations, but it&#39;s nice to have a little guidance when I am able to get a run in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I&#39;m really happy with my move to Garmin. Even though I&#39;m currently not following the recommendations closely, I do feel like I can get much more out of my runs with this watch than I ever could with my Apple Watch. This thing gives me the confidence to reclaiming my old form, run a half marathon and do well in it.&lt;/p&gt;
